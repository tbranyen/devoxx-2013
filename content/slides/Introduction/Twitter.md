- Open Twitter.com.

- Almost never use the website.
  - Except for when I'm remote.

- Good for SEO, accessibility, and initial load performance.
  - Many intelligent designs could alleviate issues with loading.
    - Bootstrapping data.
    - Lazy loading JavaScript that isn't used immediately.
    - Caching, Minification, and static GZip.
