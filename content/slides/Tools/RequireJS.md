Pros:

- RequireJS uses the AMD module format.
- Works with or without a server.
- Has plugin support for loading templates.
- Manages a dependency graph of your modules.
- Handles the optimization of concatenating your code, minifying, and generating source maps.

Cons:

- Very complicated to configure and debug.

So why are we using it? Because once it's properly
configured, it's insanely easy to use.
