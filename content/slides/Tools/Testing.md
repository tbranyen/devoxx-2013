Testing
=======

So our application works fine from what we can tell, but what is our testing strategy?

<script type="speaker-notes">
- Do we even know how to test this?

- Are our modules defined in a way that makes them
easy to test?

- Will our testing support continuous integration?

- Are we hitting all lines of code we wrote?
</script>

<style scoped>
  @host {
    background-color: #FFF;
    color: #333;
  }
</style>
