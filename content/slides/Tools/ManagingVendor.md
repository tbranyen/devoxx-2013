Managing Vendor Dependencies
============================

In our application we have manually included libraries at arbitrary versions.

There is no version locking in place or knowledge of
which versions work.

<script type="speaker-notes">
- If we upgrade dependencies, do we know they will still work together?

- Where did they come from? Official sources?
</script>

  @host {
